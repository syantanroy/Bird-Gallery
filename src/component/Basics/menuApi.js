Black-backed birds are possibly confusable with White-browed, but that species is much larger and has a largely black head with a broad white supercilium. Subspecies variation among breeding adults (sexes are similar) is covered below. There is considerable variation in patterning of black on head and breast of non-breeding and first-winter birds, although in some subspecies non-breeding birds retain characteristics of breeding plumage. Juveniles of the two breeding subspecies have grey head, mantle and breast with whitish supercilium. M. a. alba (including dukhunensis) (widespread winter visitor) has grey mantle, white forehead and face, and black hind crown/nape, throat and breast. M. a. personata (breeding NW and widespread winter visitor) has grey mantle and black head and breast, with white forehead and face patch, giving rise to pale-masked appearance. M. a. alboides (breeding N and wintering more widely in N and E) is much as personata, but has black mantle and back, although upperparts of female are variably mixed with grey. M. a leucopsis (winter visitor to N, NE and Andamans) has black mantle and back, but otherwise has head pattern as breeding male alba but with white throat. M. a. ocularis (uncommon visitor to N and NE) has grey mantle and back and is much as alba, but has a black eye-stripe in all plumages. M. a. baicalensis (widespread winter visitor) has grey mantle and back and is much as alba, but has white chin and upper throat contrasting with black breast.
